    "Data comes in all shapes and sizes. Extracting useful insights from data often involves preparation and *cleaning*. Usually, data is not directly available in our Python code, instead being stored in other files or databases. One common filetype for storing data is called **JSON** (Javascript Object Notation). Python comes with built-in libraries for reading these `.json` files, which we can use to further analyse the data therein.\n",

Because of this, we would say, that *relative* to this Notebook, the file we are interested in loading is located in a directory called `Data`. To indicate that we are looking into a directory, we use a forward slash `/` - **note** that this is true for the Codespace and MacOS, but know that Windows machines usually use a backslash!.\n",

The most common way to do this is using the `with` statement and the `open` function (which come together into a *context manager*). The `as` clause of the `with` statement stores the file object into a temporary variable (here called `file`), but only until the end of the indented block.\n",
